# Jinzhen Wang / HPDi Lab website

## Checkout and authentication

Use the local-design branch of jwang-hpc/jwang-hpc.github.io. Use your existing
GitHub authentication; credentials are never stored in website source.

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch local-design
git pull --ff-only origin local-design
python3 edit.py
```

Pull manually with a clean checkout. Saved edits on local-design can be reopened
without committing or publishing.

## Daily content editing

Run `python3 edit.py` (Python 3.9+). It fetches GitHub and opens `local-design`.
Clean checkouts pull that branch with a fast-forward. Saved local edits are
preserved and skip automatic pulling; you can close and reopen without publishing.
If the network is unavailable or branch histories diverge, the editor opens
local files and prints a notice. Resolve divergent histories before publishing.
Dirty checkouts on another branch and unfinished merges require manual resolution.
Startup never merges `main`; you manage upstream merges and deployment yourself.
No forced pushes, automatic stashes, discarded files, or main-branch pushes.
Git name/email and authentication must already be configured for publishing.

After synchronization, the current website is rebuilt and checked and the editor
opens at http://127.0.0.1:8765/admin/. If the port is occupied, use
`python3 edit.py --port 8766`. Ctrl+C stops the server.

1. Edit profile, news, papers, teaching, projects, people, lab or sponsors.
2. Preview the draft through the actual website build; choose Personal or Lab.
3. Save files to write checked content locally, or Publish to save, commit, and
   push to `local-design`. Commit messages summarize affected sections,
   added/removed records, and updated fields.
4. Review the branch/PR, then merge into main to update the public site.

Publish is a review-branch push, not a live deployment. The included workflow
publishes `dist/` after changes reach main. Save files alone does not commit;
saved changes remain available when reopening the editor. An interrupted
push can be retried with Publish without creating a duplicate commit. Code edits
outside content must be committed separately before Publish.

Browser drafts are retained and protected against stale source revisions. Download
an unsaved draft before loading current content. Imports preserve the current
design; design values in an old content draft are not applied by this editor.
Exact draft preview needs the local service. The hosted editor supports forms
and JSON import/export, without browser-side design controls or a duplicate page
renderer. Embedded previews disable scripts; test interactive features on the
saved website at http://127.0.0.1:8765/.

## Design changes

There are no design sliders, palettes, or layout presets in the content editor.
Use a design XML file or ask your assistant to change the source templates/styles.
XML must use the supported HPDi version-1 design schema, not arbitrary XML from
another application. Export a reference schema for a third-party tool:

```bash
python3 scripts/design_xml.py export HPDi-design.xml
python3 scripts/design_xml.py import /path/to/updated-design.xml
```

The importer validates the file, backs up changed design settings and rebuilds.
Commit and push these design changes manually. Content editing preserves them.

## Direct edits and deployment

`content/*.json` is authoritative content; `content/design.json` holds design
settings. `build.py` and renderer modules generate pages, `assets/` contains
styles, scripts, fonts and images. Never edit generated `dist/` files.

```bash
python3 build.py
python3 scripts/check_site.py
```

The Pages workflow belongs in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. Settings → Pages →
Source must be GitHub Actions. Keep `dist/`, caches and `.editor-state/` ignored.
The build removes previous dist output before generating the current pages, so
retired demo pages and assets cannot remain in deployment.

## CV, update date and citations

In Profile, choose a PDF under Curriculum vitae (maximum 10 MB). Upload writes
`assets/cv/jinzhen-wang.pdf` locally; Save or Publish applies the link. Publish
includes the PDF. The public CV button opens the PDF in an on-page viewer.
The existing CV link remains until you upload a replacement.

Publish sets the Last update label to the push day in America/New_York. Manual
pushes to local-design are also stamped by stamp-updated.yml (a bot commit may
appear; pull it before your next push). Merging main later preserves that date.

Papers support a DOI and optional publisher BibTeX. Fetch publisher BibTeX uses
publisher-deposited Crossref metadata; review it before saving. Google Scholar,
IEEE and ACM BibTeX exports can also be pasted into the same field. The build
uses that BibTeX, then verified DOI metadata, then a minimal local fallback.
Only the current design is built; compact.json and retired demo assets are removed.

## GitHub push confirmation

The local editor checks GitHub on opening, every minute while visible, and via
Check GitHub. Publish confirms that the saved commit is present in the remote
local-design history, including when the date-stamping bot has added a newer
commit. A successful Git command alone is not treated as confirmation.
The status panel distinguishes confirmed, saved/unpublished, unpushed, behind,
diverged and unconfirmed states, with a last-check time. Failed or uncertain
pushes keep their pending commit for retry and show a reminder; closing the
editor also warns about saved/unpushed or unconfirmed work. Reopening checks
again. These reminders appear in the editor; no background/email reminder runs.

## Embedded design assistant

Choose Design changes in the local editor. Under API connection, enter your
OpenAI API key and leave Remember on this computer checked to load it on restart.
It is saved in .editor-state/openai-credentials.json with owner-only permissions,
excluded from GitHub, previews and exports. Uncheck Remember and reconnect to
remove the saved key. Alternatively set OPENAI_API_KEY before startup.
The default model is gpt-5.4; OPENAI_DESIGN_MODEL can override it. Keys are never
returned to the browser or stored in browser storage.
You need your own OpenAI API account/billing. This is a separate API assistant,
not a connection to an existing ChatGPT conversation or subscription.

Describe the design change, inspect the proposed diff, then Preview proposal.
Apply locally writes validated settings to content/design.json and styling to
assets/assistant-design.css, with local backups. Content drafts are preserved.
Publish applied design commits and pushes those reviewed files to local-design
and verifies GitHub receipt. Publish saved content first if it is also modified;
main is changed only by your own merge.

The assistant receives current design settings, styles and rendered public
Personal/Lab HTML, plus the design requests in this server session. It supports
bounded settings and CSS, without executing generated scripts or rewriting
Python templates. No files change merely by chatting or previewing. A stale
proposal must be regenerated after source changes. Conversation/key state lasts
until the local server is restarted. Larger structural changes can still be
made through direct source work with Codex.

The integration uses the OpenAI Responses API with structured outputs:
https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs?api-mode=responses

### Upload a paper PDF
Choose Papers, select a paper, and use Upload paper PDF (up to 10 MB).
The file is saved as assets/papers/<record-id>.pdf and replaces the Paper link,
while preserving DOI and other links. Preview and Save or Publish to apply the
link; Publish includes uploaded PDFs on local-design. Existing PDFs are backed
up before replacement. External paper URLs remain supported.
